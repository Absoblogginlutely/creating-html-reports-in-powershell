If you're having problems, want to do something and can't figure out how, found a bug and want to offer a correction, or just have feedback on this guide or the EnhancedHTML module, I'd love to hear from you. 

The easiest way is to post in the "General Q&A" forum on [http://powershell.org/wp/forums/](http://powershell.org/wp/forums/). I keep a pretty close eye on that, and I'll respond as soon as I'm able.

Do check back from time to time, to make sure you've got the most recent version of this guide and its code.
